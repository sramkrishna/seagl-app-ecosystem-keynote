          <h3 class="r-fit-text"> Community Manager @ Intel for oneAPI </h3>

          <ul>
            <li> Started contributing to the GNOME Project in 1997 </li>
            <li> Helped build community and engagement within the project </li>

            I want to thank the organizers for SeaGL for giving me this
            opportunity to passionately talk about this ecosystem. SeaGL
            has always been about allowing newcomers to have the
            opportunity to present. That goes for me as well, since this
            is my first talk that's labeled a keynote and I've been in
            open source for 23 years or more.

          <h2> Who and what is the App Ecosystem? </h2>
            <img src="/images/App-Ecosystem.svg" alt="">

          <aside class="notes">
            Let's first define, what I'm talking about - The Linux App
            Ecosystem. It's essentiallye everyone who is volunteers
            their time to support writing applications on the Linux
            platforms. Documentation, bug triagers, social engagers,
            toolkit writers, middleware, frameworks, designers - the
            Linux App Ecosystem is a meta ecosystem that involves every
            skill set you can think of.

            There is an important cross section that is also part of the app community

          </aside>

        <section>
          <img src="/images/App-Community-People.svg">

          <aside class="notes">
            That's right - the maintainers, the people who write the apps, who help design them - even the people who just make you feel good just talking to them!

          <p> Year of the Desktop </p>

          <aside class="notes">
            
              When people think about the app ecosystem - invariably
              this meme comes of YEAR OF THE DESKTOP

              I hate this meme. 

              It makes me see red. 
          </aside>

          <p style="color: red">Year of the Desktop</p>
          <aside class="notes">
              Because it implies that building a
              platform for applications is sisypheusian task. Endlessly,
              working on something but seemingly making new progress. Working
              in obscurity. 

              It's even a joke inside our own - a sarcastic comment,
              making fun of ourselves.

              Even the 'desktop' has turned into an instant turn
              off. That's why we're the app ecosystem - because you likely
              won't get a competitive talk slot. That's how harmful that
              meme is.

              Why haven't we taken over the desktop? Why is the MacBook
              the choice of open source folks? Where are the apps? Where
              are we going? What strides have been made?

        <section>
          We've made great strides even withou the attention and
          investment that we used to have. We are only getting
          better. The app ecosystem is a small group, barely over 2000
          core people. Our work speaks for itself.
        </section> 

        <section>
          Today on the FlatHub App store we have over 2343 desktop apps,
          serving over 88.3 TB of data per day. Representing over a
          1.3 billion downloads this year. Average download of apps
          per month is 4 million. This year alone we added 500 new
          applications. The next steps now is to start being able to
          allow developers to handle payments, offer subscriptions,
          and so on. It will be an all new phase in Linux land.
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <p> These numbers will improve as we make more investments in building better documentation, improved infrastructure, and streamlined maintainability of code. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p> Also realize that investment in essentially the consumer part of the ecosystem means that other projects like the kernel, laptop companies all become more viable because consumptions means that more consumer hardware vendor will be willing to support Linux.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p> I leave you with this thought: </p>
          <p class="fragement blur"> "When working towards achieving your aims as a community. The highest compliment is not that you are achieving it - but that progress is changing the lives for the better."
