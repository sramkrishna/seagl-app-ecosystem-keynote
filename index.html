            I want to thank the organizers for SeaGL for giving me this
            opportunity to passionately talk about this ecosystem. SeaGL
            has always been about allowing newcomers to have the
            opportunity to present. That goes for me as well, since this
            is my first talk that's labeled a keynote and I've been in
            open source for 23 years or more.

          <aside class="notes">
            Let's first define, what I'm talking about - The Linux App
            Ecosystem. It's essentiallye everyone who is volunteers
            their time to support writing applications on the Linux
            platforms. Documentation, bug triagers, social engagers,
            toolkit writers, middleware, frameworks, designers - the
            Linux App Ecosystem is a meta ecosystem that involves every
            skill set you can think of.

            There is an important cross section that is also part of the app community

            That's right - the maintainers, the people who write the apps, who help design them - even the people who just make you feel good just talking to them!
